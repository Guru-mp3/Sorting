# Sorting
## Aim/Objective
To write a Code to Sort an array of Integers
## Theory
Sorting is a process of ordering individual elements of a list according to their proper rank, either in ascending or descending order. We can easily sort a list of elements by means of iteration /loop and if-condition check statements. Sorting algorithms can be implemented by any programming languages. One outer loop and one inner loop inside the outer loop will do the purpose.  There are the several internal sorting used in practical fields.

    Bubble Sort- A sorting algorithm which compares one element to its next element and if requires it swaps like a bubble.
    Selection Sort - A sorting algorithm which selects a position in the elements and compares it to the rest of the positions one by one.
    Insertion Sort - One element from the array is selected and is compared to the one side of the array and inserted to the proper position while shifting the rest of the elements accordingly.  
    Quick Sort - A sorting algorithm which divides the elements into two subsets and again sorts recursively.
    Heap Sort - A sorting algorithm which is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. ,
    Merge sort - A sorting algorithm which divides the elements to subgroups and then merges back to make a sorted.
    Radix Sort - A sorting algorithm used for numbers. It sorts the elements by rank of the individual digits.
